"This plugin hooks in the authenticate filter. By default, the plugin is set "
"to allow all access and you can configure the plugin to allow the login only "
"from some specified IPs or the specified countries. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT "
"YOU CONFIGURE THE PLUGIN TO ALLOW YOUR OWN ACCESS. If you set a restriction "
"by IP, then you have to add your own IP (if you are using the plugin in a "
"local setup the IP is 127.0.0.1 or ::1, this is added in your list by "
"default). If you set a restriction by country, then you have to select from "
"the list of countries at least your country. The both types of restrictions "
"work independent, so you can set only one type of restriction or both if you "
"want."
